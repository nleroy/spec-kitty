"""#3883: a blocked decision names where each failing guard looked.

The reported dead end was not only that the advance path disagreed with the
query path — it was that ``blocked — guard_failures: ["qa-traceability.yaml",
"test-report.md"]`` gave an operator nothing to act on. Everything inspectable
said the artifacts were present; the one command that advances said they were
missing; and nothing in the output said which directory it had read. Telling
the two apart required reading ``runtime/next/runtime_bridge.py``.

So the reporter's second remedy stands on its own, independently of the root
cause: name the specific file **and the specific path it looked at**. These
tests pin that, plus the two properties that keep the diagnostics honest — the
path comes from the same placement seam the guard itself reads through, and
producing it can never change the decision.

**#4390 amendment.** The original version of this file fed
``guard_failures=["spec.md", "tasks.md"]`` — bare filenames — straight into a
``mission="software-dev"`` decision. That data shape never occurs for a
registered mission family: every entry in
``runtime_bridge_cores._GUARD_TABLES`` (software-dev/research/documentation/
plan) reports a genuine missing-artifact failure as the human-readable
message ``"Required artifact missing: {name}"``
(``runtime_bridge_cores.MISSING_ARTIFACT_MESSAGE``), not a bare filename —
and mixes it with free-form NON-artifact failures (WP status, source counts,
dependency fields, ...) that name no real artifact at all. Bare filenames are
the shape ``evaluate_guards_strict``'s fail-closed branch returns for an
*unregistered custom* mission family (no ``_GUARD_TABLES`` entry) — a
genuinely different code path, covered separately below by
``TestUnregisteredCustomFamilyBareTags``.

Feeding the registered-family shape bare filenames made every one of these
tests pass against the #4390 bug: ``artifact_search_paths(...,
names=guard_failures)`` treated each bare string as a literal filename either
way, so the test could not tell "resolved a real tag" apart from "echoed
whatever string it was given". The tests below use each shape as it actually
occurs.
